./part1   
# WordCount (with sort by counts). 
# This program generates two output files: wc_sorted.txt and wc_sorted_word_counts.txt. We separated this problem into two Mapreduce tasks: (1) the first one counts the frequencies of each words; (2) the second one filters and sorts the output file.  
# It must be noted here that, we provides two versions of program: (a) without removing any special character for words (WordCount1_unremoval.java); and (b) we removed the special characters except "-" and "'" (Default). 
$ sh run.sh



./part2   # MutualFriendFinder This program generates one output file: MutualFriendFinder.txt
$ sh run.sh
