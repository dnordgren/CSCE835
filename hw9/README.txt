Homework 9 (Group 8)

./part1   # WordCount (with sort by counts). This program generates two output files: wc_sorted.txt and wc_sorted_word_counts.txt. We separated this problem into two Mapreduce tasks: (1) the first one counts the frequencies of each words; (2) the second one filters and sorts the output file.  
$ sh run.sh



./part2   # MutualFriendFinder This program generates one output file: MutualFriendFinder.txt
$ sh run.sh
